## 🧹 Data Cleaning Steps
1. **Removed duplicates** – no duplicate rows found.  
2. **Checked for missing values** – none found.  
3. **Standardized column names** – converted to snake_case (`customer_id`, `gender`, `age`, `annual_income_k`, `spending_score`).  
4. **Converted data types** – numeric columns converted to integers/floats where needed.  
5. **Standardized categorical values** – ensured `gender` has only `Male` and `Female`.  
6. **Outlier check** – unrealistic ages (>90) removed.  
7. **Final dataset saved as** `mall_customers_cleaned.csv`.
